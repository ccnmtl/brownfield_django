                         signs posted on both sides of hte road - both sides of the road have pine barreds\
                         vegetation (dominated by scrub oak and pine) with light-colored or beige soils that are\
                         visibly sandy and gravelly. About 0.3 mile further down the road is a narrow clearing on both\
                         sides of the road. ~20 feet wide extending NW-SE; stopped car on side of road; there is little vegetation\
                         in these cleared strips except for low, scraggly weeds; to the NE 40-50 feet from road is a brick building \
                         (20 ft. square) sitting in the middle of the clearing; on the building is a sign stating \
                         No Trespassing/Township of Moraine/Division of Water Supply - the building is possibly a pumping station\
                         becasue the clearing runs straight up hill all the way to the other side and extends straight downhill \
                         (about two football fields away) to another brick building which (with my binoculars) looks to be several \
                         times the size of the first building; Ill try to check this building out when I close my loop at the end of the day.\

                   a local Dairy Queen type of operation - a bit run down, dusty gravel parking lot - the property sits on a triangle\
                   formed at the intersection of Rt. 66E and Loess Lane. Directly S across Loess Lane is what appears to be more Township\
                   property that ran all along the E side of Rt. 66E on my way up to BTEX - however the vegetation has changed to a\
                   deciduous forest (second or third growth) with the older trees mayber 50 to 70 years old - the soils are visually\
                   finer and dark brown in color.\

                     <p>9:45 AM - As I proceed E on Loess Lane there is a small strip of land with a few trees\
                     that appears distinct frm the asphalt parking lot of Kilroys Bar (7 Loess Lane) - \
                     the frontage of this bar is about 200 feet - just beyond the bar is another open area with more\
                     trees and undergrowth (~100 feet of frontage) - directly across from this open space is a large\
                     asphalt driveway/enternce to the parking lot for the Wedging Nursery (at 10 Loess Lane) - as I\
                     pull into the parking lot I find it to be a bustling place with the small trucks and vans of \
                     local landscapers loading sod, dirt, chips, etc.</p>\
                     <p>There are three long greenhouses on the W side of the Wedging \

                     large and two smaller building around the lot - outback (to the S)\
                     from what I could see from the lot was a large sod farm with other \
                     growing areas for trees and shrubs(somewhere between 5 and 10 acres);\
                     just at the S end of the parking lot is a small square shed with old hose,\
                     pipe, and other irrigation equipment laying around - there are several large \
                     trees interspersed on the site and many trees and low growth bordering on the site. \
                     Just before leaving the nuersery I picked up a business card in the main office which \
                     says Wedging Nursery/serving landscapers and gardeners since 1980/Rachel Kent, Proprietor.</p>\

                    an auto wrecker and scrap metal business - there is a large fence surrounding the property\
                    - the front gate was open - the paved road extends straight in to the N ending in about 150 yds.\

                    building lifting metal into a compactor- a real junkyard complete with the yelping of junkyard dogs that\

                       the Wedging family homestead (12 Loess Lane). A large 2 1/2 story edifice \

                       10:30 - Ive finally arrived at the front entrance to the abandoned, \
                       Self-Lume factory site Lane(20 Loess Lane) which is about a football field \
                       away from the Wedging driveway and also on the S side of Loess. My key to the \
                       building itself is for the padlocked door in the rear parking lot but I also have\
                       keys for the chainlink gates at both entrances. The property is surrounded by an\
                       eight foot chain link fence. THe 200 ft entrance driveway extends straight to the\
                       S and is surrounded by dense deciduous forest with many large and intermediate trees\
                       and heavy undergrowth especially along the sides of the road. Coming down the road I\
                       can see part of the a water (?) tank on the roof. The foilage is the same around the\
                       parking lot. Both the road and the parking lot are littered with twigs, leaves and the\
                       like. The parking lot is about 150 ft wide and 300 ft long with a rectangular island \
                       (approx 30 x 200 ft) of trees and undergrowth right in the middle of the parking lot. \
                       From the S end of the lot there are two sidewalks about 100 ft apart, the W one leading\
                       to the main entrance (with a slightly rusted Self-Lume, Inc. sign still in place over \
                       the entrance portico) and the E sidewalk leading to a smaller less imposing entrance probably\
                       for workers. Nothing seems unusual - single story, cinder block construction, a flat root\
                       not visible form the ground level, the windows are still intact and closed - the tan paint\
                       is weathered and peeling in places - empty office rooms (no furniture, no debris) are all \
                       one can see through the dirty windows. Large weeds, overgrown shrubs, and several young, \
                       invading trees now surround the building at the front end along the W wall; however at the\
                       SE corner of the parking lot is a sleared area about 40 ft wide running along the E wall\
                       of the factory - all that is growing here are weeds and grasses - the substrate consists\
                       of 3/4 inch diameter gravel with some dirt in the pore spaces - it looks like and old\
                       access road but it is inaccessible to vehicles because seven large glacial erratics have\
                       been moved into place at the edge of the parking lot in front of the cleared area. With\
                       binoculars I can see that this old road extends to the rear parking lot where I will \
                       have a better look.\

                       down from the Self-Lume entrance is a road running straight to\
                       a large red barn and then another 150 ft. down the road is a \
                       driveway and a garage followed by a large two story red sandstone home.\
                       There is a sign near the mailbox which indicates that this home is an\
                       Esker County historic site and was build in 1837 as apart of the Fallow Farm.\
                       The mailbox also says Meredith and James Fallow (25 Loess Lane) so \
                       I presume tha some part of the family continues to live here. The home\
                       sits on the NW corner of Loess Lane and Erratic Avenue and is nicely \
                       landscaped with several very large elegant oaks. On the NE corner there is a \
                       second or third growth forest with dense undergrowth and many intermediate trees.\
