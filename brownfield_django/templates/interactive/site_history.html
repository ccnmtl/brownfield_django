Al Milankovitch
Al Milankovitch, operator of the BTEX gas station

1. ["Well my sister Tillie keeps all the records for this place. So  you can just go to the diner next door to find her. You may also check with the DPW if you're looking for permits and inspection reports of our underground storage tanks."
2. No. I don't believe that people get sick cause of stuff in the environment. That's just some new cause that they invented. I've worked at a gas station my whole life and I ain't seen a doctor in over eight years and I'm fine. Now don't go startin' trouble about my gasoline, and where it comes from, and how it's stored, like ole Turlover did in the early 80s.
3. My brother Jake worked there. He started in basic productions and then was promoted to operations. You can find him at 34 Pleistocene Court. A lot of my customers were also employees there. While you're over there you may also talk to Connie. I think she worked in the lab.
4. They made exit signs. My brother Jake would be a good person to ask specific questions because he started in basic productions and later was the supervisor of operations. You can find him at 34 Pleistocene. 
That factory was a good thing to have in town, and they ran it so well that there were never any problems. I've only heard one complaint from its employees.  Mal Sangre, rest his soul, was havin' some problems with glass when he was cleanin' the septic tanks. You can be sure as soon as they became aware of the problem it was cleaned up right away.	
My brother told me they had a lot of meetings when they first fell on hard times cause they wanted to try to save the company. Preneur, the owner, really did not want to see that place close. They would have done anything to save the business.	
Well if traffic increases, more traffic means more gas.	
I don't read them kind of stories. You should go straight to Ivana Lede, the editor. She might live in the Kame Kondos, I'm not sure exactly where she lives, but I do know she drives a Honda if that helps ya.	
"I knew a lot of the guys who worked at the factory.  You should start with my brother Jake over at 34 Pleistocene to see what he got to say. Also, go to the diner and ask Tillie. She's better with makin' suggestions. Tell her I sent ya, and be sure to have some pie.""]],

	My old friend Mal Sangre died of a rare blood disorder that may have had environmental causes.					
	No, I did not have any. My good friend James Fallow sold the property that Self-Lume was located on to Andre Preneur in 1974. At the time, I was aware of the details of the sale.					
	That doesn't much interest me. You should find someone in town who used to work there. Maybe Rhea Kruter.					
	You'd be better to ask my niece, Connie Ferm, who lives at Eolian Acres on Pleistocene Court.					
	I don't know enough about it to answer that question.					
	I think it's a terrible use of the land. They should just leave the factory and the old farm structures that still exist on the property. We don't need any more development.					
	Not any that were of much interest

    		["Try the municipal complex for that sort of information. You should look into my current complaint about the water of Moraine because this is very serious. Go to the health department and ask for information about the quality of the water. I've noticed that the water has a faint spell of gasoline	 so try to find out any information that you can about BTEX Gas Station and its underground storage tanks."		
			I can start with the ones in my house. My children have been cranky and irritable and all of us have been experiencing stomach aches. Then it all started to make sense when I realized one day that the water smelled a little bit funny and didn't taste quite right. You can't take those kinds of chances when it comes to drinking water.		
			I had none. That place was too dark and musty for me to work there with my allergies. You could talk to my neighbor, Jake Milankovitch, who worked there for years. I think that he was in charge of operations or productions or something.		
			Enough. I've seen those radiation signs on the fence. I watch the news; I know what those kinds of things can lead to. Who's looking out for us when big business introduces radioactive chemicals into our local environment? Those are the questions you need to join me in asking Mayor Kettle and Anne Spector of the health department.		
			Well, I hope the town has been doing its job. It's the responsibility of the government to protect us from the potential hazards from industry. The town was so buddy-buddy with Self-Lume that they may not have investigated the most important things. How is it possible that the guy who cleaned their septic tanks was getting cut by broken glass, but the factory always got perfect health inspections? Does that sound like a healthy work environment? Well, huh?		
			I really didn't follow it, but I want to know if they took all those dangerous chemicals with them when they left or if they're still sitting there, seeping into our local soil. I heard that a guy named Gruntl has some interesting things to say about what they were doing at the end to save the company. He lives around here.		
			Yeah, it would make it a lot easier for me to run errands, but I'm sure there won't be enough parking. Those places never have enough parking.		
			I've been featured in several articles that appeared in a series about drinking water a few months ago. I explained that there were faint traces of gasoline smell in our drinking water. However, they always shortened my quotes. I hope that they do another story soon. We can't let people forget about important issues like this.		








["Here is the paperwork for a purchase requisition made by the DPW when we ordered exits signs from Self-Lume for the municipal buildings. Is that of any help to you? [check your documents after your visit is completed]"			
There's really nothing that I can think of.			
I never worked for them.			
I can tell you that their products were made extremely well. Those things last for years.			
I just know the business end, and everything was fine there.			
Their products were built so well that no one ever needed to replace them.			
I think that there are some definite benefits for the township and the taxpayers. It may make it easier if we can obtain more supplies and fill more orders using local merchants.			
The stories about the water problems have been really interesting. However, I probably shouldn't encourage you to read about something that could be so potentially scandalous for the township. Interview Ann O. Ying and Sue Spishus about it because they were in a lot of those articles.

["I could pull some of the tax records for the property and check for exemptions	 but it would be very time-consuming	 but you have to remember that we have over eight thousand taxable real estate properties and over two hundred exempt properties. I can tell you that there has been a lien on that property every since they went bankrupt and filed chapter eleven."	
I've only worked here for two years, so there's not much other information that I can help you with. I can tell you that recently there have been a lot of complaints about the quality of the drinking water. Some residents are claiming that it's contaminated. We need to take care of these problems quickly. Bad publicity can lower property values, which could really hurt the town.			
That place was closed long before I started working in Moraine. I've heard good things about it though. Now I just calculate annually how much is owed to us in back taxes and adjust the lien accordingly.			
I just know that all the town's exit signs were purchased there. So they must be good. We only buy the best with the taxpayers' money.			
I wasn't around at the time that the factory was in operation to observe its relationship with the town. As far as I know, their taxes were in order until they filed chapter eleven. At that point a lien was put on the property that won't be removed until the property sold and the town is paid what it is owed in taxes.			
I heard that there was a fire there shortly after it closed. They're still battling with the insurance company to get the money for that because abandoned properties technically are not covered by fire insurance. I know that Preneur, the owner, had hoped to use the insurance money to help pay taxes on the property.			
The township will be happy to see the sale to Malls-‘R-Us go through so that we can collect on what's owed.			
Each year that I have been here they have done a story in March about tips for paying taxes. I love those issues.

They're a part of life, and sometime death.			
I had none.			
You think that my job is morbid because I have to write death certificates. Think about how their employees felt working at a place that had signs with skull and cross bones on them warning about chemicals. That's a daily reminder of your mortality..			
It'd be better to ask the mayor.			
Businesses come and go, just like people.			
I'd just wish they would make up their minds and do it. I don't care what goes there, I'm just tired of hearing everybody talk about Self-Lume and offer their theories about Mal Sangre, the closing, the fire, and all that other stuff.			
I haven't been following those. I only read the obituaries and the birth announcements.

["I'm sorry	 but I just can't help you with that. The only thing that I have that's near official is a letter that Mal sent to Self-Lume when he was having a problem with the waste in the septic tanks. Do you want to see that? I can show you a copy of the letter if you like."			
Well, I've heard a lot of people question whether Mal's death was the result of pollution. And I just don't believe it. We had been together over forty years when he died so we were exposed to the exact same environment, and I don't have his health problems-polycythemia vera. Big word, isn't it? Some people thought he might have been at a high risk because of the nature of his job, you know cleaning septic tanks. But no one else at Honey Dipper has had any similar problems. They even checked out other employees in the places that Mal regularly serviced, and they checked out fine. No, I think that it was just his time.				
Mal was responsible for cleaning their septic tanks and no one else ever did it in the twenty years that they were in operation. Mal prided himself on never missing work. By the time he was really sick, the factory had already closed. In all his years there, he only had a problem once when his hands were getting cut from broken glass in the septic tanks. The problem was quickly resolved when he brought it to their attention. But let's focus on all the good memories.				
Well, Dr. Scribe has been doing some research on the disease that Mal had. She read that there was a connection between it and radiation. She thought she had a lead when she learned that the factory used some sort of chemical in its signs. But it turned out to just be a coincidence because there is no way that Mal could have been exposed to it through the septic tank. They had a special contractor who disposed of it. If anyone were at risk, it would have been the contractor. Can I get you another cup of tea?				
When I taught in Moraine, the factory was always willing to help sponsor programs and fundraisers. They really gave back to the community.				
No, but Mal sure was sad when he learned that they were closing. It wasn't long after that that he got very sick.				
It could make it easier for me to do my marketing and run errands, but it will really pain me to see them tear down that place.				
There was a lot of stories when Mal got sick, partly because he was so loved and also because his illness was such a medical mystery.				
"Dr. Scribe has taken a particular interest in Mal's case and she wouldn't mind if you visited her at home in Kame Kondos. Shea D'Bisnez also knew a lot about the company. Talk to her.""]],

["Do you think that you'll find something if I pull out the building permits? Our records are simply comprised of building permits and certificates of occupancy in accordance with the uniform construction code that the state established. We also have some information about zoning ordinances	 because we administer them	 and the supervision of some inspections to check compliance with the townships' code. To be perfectly honest	 the only records that are pertinent to the building of that site date back to the mid-70s. Those records are buried in basement storage and many were destroyed by water damage.  If you ask local residents	 I'm sure you'll find all the information you need about problems with the Lee Go Construction company and their work on Self-Lume. People in this town love that sort of gossip."
The stress from this job is the only health concern I worry about.				
A lot of the employees ate at Tillie's Diner, a place I've frequented for years. Maybe Tillie could be of help.				
All I know is that that exit sign over the door was manufactured by them. The best part of my day is 5:00 when I rush past it.				
The town was a little worried when they first were constructing the factory because there were so many problems. The Lee Go Construction Company was in the middle of contract negotiations with the union that represents their employees, and things were not going well. This caused tension on the site and a serious delay in the plans. When they finally finished, they did such a rushed job that some of  the original structures from the Fallow Farm were left on the site. I'm surprised that the building passed inspection. Once the construction company was out of the picture, Self-Lume had a great relationship with the town.				
There was a fire that followed it. I don't know much about it, but it seems like an insurance ploy. Speak to the fire inspector. 				
Trust me. This office is too understaffed to handle all that construction at once.				
You should go straight to the editor, Ivana Lede. She lives in town.

But here is the report for the fire that occurred after operations shut down and the alarm report. We ruled out arson	 but we couldn't get much more specific about the cause.

Mal Sangre was quite a loss to our community. They still haven't determined what killed him.				
I inspected the premises when they were in operation and inspected the site following the fire.				
I know that the town purchased their exit signs that are required by law from the factory.				
I don't know of any problems.				
I know from my investigation that the fact that the fire followed the factory's closing was sheer coincidence. They weren't even able to collect fire insurance because the insurance company considered it an abandoned lot. You know, once a property is abandoned or unoccupied, it's usually not covered by fire insurance.				
I have some concerns, but if they're compliant, I'm sure that everything will work out.				
There were some stories about the fire. Did you speak with Ivana Lede over in the Kame Kondos?

["I don't have that information here. But I could make a few phone calls for you. I could get in touch with Mayor Kettle or Anne Spector of the health department."				
That's a great question because I'm particularly concerned with environmental issues. Water is the most pertinent issue on our constituents' minds right now and I'm committed to calming their fears. I think the privatetesting that the township is investing in is important because we can't take chances with our water. I've been active in following up the initial complaints of Mrs. Ying and Mrs. Spishus.				
I was elected to the council after the factory closed, but I always had an excellent working relationship with the employees there. If you need to speak to someone who worked there, let me know and I'll make a phone call. I could put you in touch with Rhea Kruter or Jake Milankovitch, who both played important roles in the company.				
I have no reason to question the dependable products that were manufactured there or the efficient manner in which the office was run. They took extreme precaution with the tritium that was used on the site. They even had an expensive private contractor who was responsible for moving the radioactive waste. I don't know his name, but Shea D'Bisnez or Connie Ferm would be good people to ask.				
I was elected to the council after the factory closed, but I know that the township always maintains an excellent working condition with all of the commercial and industrial sites in Moraine. The factory always had good inspections from the health department. You can ask Anne Spector. The fire inspector could also show you a report of the fire that followed the closing. Maybe Shea D'Bisnez could elaborate on the actual problems that led to the closing.				
I know that the council has a good rapport with the owners of Self-Lume, Inc. and they agree that the property must be sold to the industry that can best serve the needs of the residents of Moraine.				
I'm still trying to get a sense of where the residents stand on this issue. What do think of the proposed plan?				
Our local paper does an excellent job of covering those stories and I'm often called for a quote. Ivana Lede is the best person to talk to about those type of things. I can give her a call for you or you can visit her at the Kame Kondos.

Years back a man by the name of Turlover, Nate was his first name, led a campaign for greater sensitivity to environmental issues in town. He wasn't very successful, but I think that his son is still around if you want to question him.				
I was a very close friend of Mal Sangre, the Honey Dipper employer who was responsible for cleaning their septic tanks. That was my closest connection. He always had wonderful things to say about the company. He only once complained in his twenty years of servicing them. I forget what the problem was. I think that his widow Betty still has the letter that he wrote. That was the closest I got to professional dealings with Self-Lume.				
They made all the exit and bathroom signs that you see at any municipal building in town. Although I cannot pull the records dating back that far because they have yet to sort and enter them in a database, the records would show you nothing more than that we paid our bill. If you are going to purchasing, they can show you a copy of any requisition orders for the signs. Those records are more accessible.				
There's not much to say about it from my perspective.				
I know that they were having financial troubles. Maybe the fault lies with the person responsible for handling their finances. I don't know. I prefer not to think about other people's financial troubles; I'm busy enough with the town's. Do you have any idea how much it's costing us to have privatetesting of the water? Never mind that I said that.

I worked on the production line for a few years.				
I helped to produce the signs. It's very simple. The trick to the whole thing is the tritium. It puts the self-luminous quality in the Self-Lume products.				
The town hired me after I was laid off, so their relationship was fine as far as I was concerned.				
They fell on hard times and did everything that they could to avoid closing. In fact, I heard that they were so committed to saving the plant that the lab supervisor and her assistant tried to help cut costs by flushing…taking all necessary action.				
I don' t really care. Are they going to take down those old farm structures on the site first?				
That reporter lady asked a lot of questions about tritium, the lab supervisor, and the decrease in the amount of radioactive waste that was removed by the private contractor. I don't know what she was getting at, well maybe I do. It doesn't matter because she never wrote a story about it.

	Self-Lume could never have been responsible for pollution. Don't go point fingers at us about the death of Mal Sangre. There simply was no connection.

	Just because things were bad at the end doesn't mean that we changed our practices or did anything unsafe. It's just coincidence that Mal Sangre voiced that complaint in later years.

		The current concerns over drinking water have forced us to make bottled water available until the matter is resolved. Please don't report anything that would make the parents any more nervous.						
		We had some programs where they would come into the schools and do lectures and demonstrations. In the later years, Rhea Kruter allowed some of our school children to take field trips there. Of course, there were many areas where the students were not permitted due to the presence of heavy industrial materials or nuclear chemicals. We would never put our students at risk.

		As far as the schools were concerned, it was a great learning opportunity for students.

That was really a problem in the septic tanks that never would have affected our students. Nonetheless, we let the health department check it out and they got a clean bill of health.

They were a little concerned when they heard that a nearby site was using radioactive chemicals, but the Self-Lume management provided the information that convinced my investors that there was nothing to worry about.						
		The company uses a radioactive chemical in producing their exit signs that keeps them lit. They pose no threat to the community or to the environment because they take all necessary precautions and procedures. If there were any risk, I never would have started a nursery here.

I wasn't so involved with the business affairs or with some of the more technical things that our lab supervisor Shea D'Bisnez handled. Now I realize that you're one of those environmental people who gets all worked up when you hear about the tritium we used at the plant. You can trust me that everything was safe and regulated.

		We always got along right well with the town. They respected our operations and regarded our employees as good, honest, and hardworking. We passed every one of our health inspections and we were very open with the town about all of our dealings. A couple of times we even sent Shea down to council meetings to talk to residents to explain how all radioactive waste was removed safely by a private contractor and we met all standards and guidelines of the NRC.						
		The fire was a few months later and it had nothing to do with the closing, so if you've heard any of those rumors, you should know they're false. The company just fell on hard times and couldn't quite recover. At first we thought it was the recession, but soon we knew that there were bigger problems. There's just a small market in this area for our products because they last so darn long that nobody ever replaces them. Our sales department and our delivery department just didn't have the resources to take the product to new markets, so we were caught in a crunch. In the end we were producing as much as ever, but a lot of it would just sit in the warehouse.

I don't even believe that Betty, his widow, buys that excuse. We have good land and water in this town. I know because my family farmed it for generations.						
		I worked closely with them when I was selling the property to them back around '74. It was hard because it represented what I believed was the new wave of industrial development where farms had once stood. But other industries never followed the company's lead by settling in Moraine. Trust me, though, my family is very invested in this community and I had a bunch of kids I raised here, so I wasn't about to sell to somebody I couldn't trust.						
		After I sold the property to Self-Lume some twenty-five years ago, I had very little to do with their business. I just enjoyed my early retirement.						
		That factory never gave Moraine any problems. It just created a lot of jobs. I thought it was a bad omen when they had all those problems with the construction company, but I was proven wrong.						
		No, but I was sorry to hear that business hadn't done so good. I remember being concerned when I heard about that fire they had after the closing, but they got it pretty well contained right quick. Actually, I think some of the original structures from our farm still remain on that site due to problems during construction.

He first went to the local papers about concerns over pesticides that were used at Roche Mountonee Vineyards and Wedging Nursery.

He also expressed his concern about the diesel fuel spill on the site in 1983.						
		They used a radioactive chemical known as tritium on the site. Around 1985 my father started asking a lot of questions about the use of the chemical and its disposal by the company because he was concerned about the potential danger if it was used or disposed of improperly.						
		Trust me, the company and the town had a great relationship. Self-Lume was a sacred cow in Moraine because it was the largest employer in the area. In fact, the issue that truly undermined Turlover's effectiveness as an environmental advocate was his inquiry into practices at the Self-Lume factory in 1985. He questioned the use and disposal of radioactive chemicals at the plant. He also expressed his concern about the diesel fuel spill that took place on the site in 1983.						
		I'm not sure why the plant closed. But I've heard that a guy in town who used to work there, I think his last name is Gruntl, charges that they were illegally dumping radioactive chemicals in order to cut costs.

		The only serious health case that I've heard of recently was Mal Sangre, who died about five years ago. Some people claim his illness was the result of pollution, but I doubt it. Mal worked for Honey Dipper, Inc. and he was responsible for cleaning our septic tanks. True he once complained that his hands had been cut by broken glass in the septic tank, but you can believe me that his death was not the result of any occupational hazard he was exposed to at Self-Lume. I was responsible for making the safety videos and for answering all of our employees' and applicants' questions about health and safety concerns at Self-Lume, so I'm the person who would know.						
		It was my first job out of college. It was somewhat surprising that they hired me for human resource in 1990 at a time when they really weren't in a position to be making new hires. I think that part of it was for morale. They wanted to show their employees that they believed the hard times would pass. I did a few hires while I was there, but mostly I focused on safety issues and re-training. I also helped the employees find new jobs when the closing was imminent. Some of them had never worked anywhere else.						
		I think that I'm most qualified to discuss the employees' handling of the radioactive chemicals, since part of my job was to train them about health and safety issues on the job. Although radioactive chemicals were used on site, no employee was ever exposed to any risks because the company took the strongest of precautions. Shea D'Bisnez, the lab supervisor, insisted on this. Trust me, I would have never worked there if they were sloppy in their handling. One former employee, D.S. Gruntl, has made accusations about illegal dumping of radioactive materials. However, I think that he is just bitter he was never promoted.						
		Because we weren't doing much hiring when I was there, I often handled some of the public relations for the company. We had a great relationship with the town. We were always willing to answer any resident concerns and we did a lot of outreach and fundraising with the local public schools.						
		One thing that really impressed me about the closing was the way they handled layoffs. They really did everything in their power to avoid putting people out of work. I can't figure how they held on to so many employees for so long. It really doesn't work out on paper.

		You probably want to know about the problems with the water. When my neighbor Ann Ying first approached me about this, I thought that she was just on another one of her rants. But she's really on to something. There is a very faint smell of something like fuel, and the water just doesn't taste right. I'm not one to overreact, but I shouldn't have to second-guess the water that comes out of my tap. Maybe someone should do some investigating at BTEX to see if anything over there, like maybe in the underground storage tanks, could have seeped into the water.						
		A lot of my neighbors worked there at one point, like Jake Milankovitch and Rhea Kruter.						
		That's not my area of expertise.						
		I really can't tell you anything about Self-Lume. I just don't know. The only rumor I heard was that Mal Sangre had some problems with the waste in the septic tanks before the plant closed. I don't know what it was; maybe the water was contaminated there first. You should talk to his widow to learn the details.						
		I really don't know. I did read a bunch of articles about the fire that occurred a few months after the closing.  It does seem a little suspicious. Maybe someone was looking to collect the insurance.						
		I'm all for economic development. If the mall is successful, it could mean lower taxes or higher property values.						
		I was interviewed several times by Ivana Lede and one of her reporters for their series about the town's water. I thought they did a responsible job of covering the issue.						
		"The health inspector has been good about following through on this issue and Mayor Kettle has taken a particular interest.

		No, no, no. We don't have problems like that in Moraine. Those are city problems. Now you may have heard allegations that the contaminated water smells like fuel, but that does not implicate our gas station.						
		Them boys that worked at the plant gave me a lot of business. Coffee and breakfast in the morning, lunch hour at the counter, and later they'd come with their families when they didn't feel like cooking. My brother Jake worked there for many years.						
		Built to last, those exit signs. It's not often you find something that reliable these days. I remember when we had a power outage some years back during a real nasty storm. Lights were out everywhere in Moraine, and those exit signs were the only thing you could see. Say, do ya know what makes 'em work?						
		It was great. You couldn't have asked for a better industry in a town like Moraine. The factory employed a lot of hardworking folks. And from what I hear, they were good bosses and their workers were very loyal. They didn't start layoffs until the very end when it was the only thing left to do.						
		I know that business just wasn't doing well. It really upset me because that's my worst fear as a business owner. It doesn't matter how invested you are in a company, you can't understand how awful it feels to file chapter eleven and be forced to close unless you're the owner. Take this example. Our gas station was first owned by my father, and my brother Al puts a lot of hard work into that place, but he doesn't take care of business matters the way I do. Like right now, I'm the one who's complaining to the company that fills our tanks because I think they're short changing us. Our prices stay steady and business is good, but our profits have fallen off slightly. Essentially, we're losing gas. It's nothing major, but as the owner I can't disregard that. Sorry to get off track, and I don't want you repeatin' this stuff, but I just want you to understand that those owners were in a difficult position. More coffee?						
		Now they told me they have no plans to add any major food establishments, so I shouldn't worry about competition. But I don't trust them. I think that my business could suffer during the day if they open a food court, but I still own the nights. Who else serves twenty-four hours?						
		There was a news story a couple years back that cleared my name when they thought that boy got sick off my food. And for the past few months, Moraine water is the big thing in the news. To be honest, those stories about possible problems caused me a couple headaches. Some of the customers started questioning the water I was serving and cooking with. I told you I pass all my health inspections and I run a clean place; I don't need that kind of hassle.						
		"Do me a favor and don't talk to that Gruntl fellow who's always making up stories about what used to go on at that place. You can't believe a word he says. He's just bitter because he had no respect for seniority. He wanted to move past guys who had put over fifteen years in that place. One of my brothers used to work there.

		I hope that you're not here to investigate pesticides. I've weathered that bad publicity once already and I showed that I'm not using anything that would hurt this community. Nate Turlover, Sr. was the one who started all that trouble for me. I don't want to go through that again. Some of the current troubles with the water quality remind me of that pesticide public relations nightmare that threatened my business and good name.						
		I had very little. Preneur, the owner, was in here a lot because he was a real wine connoisseur. I know that he was real depressed when the company fell on hard times. He told me that he did everything he could to save the sinking ship. He said he worked closely with Shea D'Bisnez on it, but their efforts were in vain. Preneur is long gone, but Shea is still in town.						
		I know that nothing they did there ever interfered with my crop. There's only been one bad season here when my parents were running the place and there was a drought in 1963. The diesel fuel spill in '83 did give me a bit of a scare, but it was really no cause for alarm.						
		I wouldn't know.						
		Hard times, probably some poor choices as well.						
		Not particularly. Too much traffic could affect the air quality around here and that always makes me nervous with these crops.

We've been working with Ivana Lede and the other staff of the Moraine Monitor to insure that residents receive status reports on a weekly basis. Therefore	 the local paper is probably the best source for that information."					
		Any problem with the water would be the only major problem that has resulted from environmental pollution since I was first elected eleven years ago. We take the health and safety of our residents very seriously in Moraine. That is why we wasted no time in hiring a private firm to conduct watertesting. The local paper is keeping all of our residents informed of the latest news.						
		For the first six years that I was elected to the council, the factory was in operation.						
		They manufactured self-luminous exit signs at the factory. Now, I'm often presented with questions about the chemicals that were used there. They used tritium on the site, which they had a license for from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. They hired a private contractor to remove radioactive waste and both the NRC and our Health Department conducted routine inspections of the intermediate disposal practices. There were never any problems.						
		The company had an excellent working relationship with the township. It met all guidelines and regulations, was a major supporter of many township-sponsored, and provided jobs to many of our hardworking residents.						
		I know that the management of the factory did everything in their power to avoid filing chapter eleven. As far as the sale of the property, a lot of that will depend on you, won't it? I don't think you'll find any problems. We do a pretty good job of staying on top of things in Moraine.						
		I would like to see that kind of economic development in Moraine. It shows that we are continuing progress as we proceed into the twenty-first century.						
		There was an entire series about the water complaints about three months ago and there are regular updates. There were also several stories about Self-Lume closing and about the fire.
