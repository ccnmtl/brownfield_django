    <h1>Testing Script for Brownfield Action</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the silver pair (or 'admin'/'ccnmtl') to login and create a professor account
      </li>
      <li>Professor logins and changes password [professors can change all class account passwords. teams can change their own passwords]
      </li>
      <li>Professor creates a class (prof must notify students of course username/password out of application).
      </li>
      <li>(todo: professor includes roster list of emails which automatically email class and creates their student records (without names))
      </li>
      <li>Student logs in with course username/password [forwards to course homepage, if student/course/team account]
      </li>
      <li>Student creates/edits their record for email/name [ajaxify?]
      </li>
      <li>Student joins a team [implement /student/2/join]
      </li>
      <li>After everyone has joined teams, Professor releases Team accounts (emails students of that team) [email feature, /course/1/admin/go/ ]
      </li>
      <li>Students login to team accounts, and play game [sign contract, play link on course page]
      </li>
      <li>(optionally, Professor releases document here, and students should see it) [release document feature /course/1/admin/release]
      </li>
      <li>Professor switches course to Phase II [course/1/admin/phase2 ]
      </li>
      <li>Students login to team accounts, and play game
      </li>
    </ol>
